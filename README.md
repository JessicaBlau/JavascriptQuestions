## Description

This project includes implementations of JavaScript functions for handling shapes and arrays. It consists of two parts: JavaScript + SVG and JavaScript + Arrays.

## Part 2: JavaScript + SVG

### Description

The JavaScript function `generateSVG` takes a JSON array of shape objects as input and generates an SVG string representing the shapes. Each shape object has a `type` (string) and `points` (array) property. The SVG string includes `<rect>` elements for shapes with a type of "rectangle" and `<polygon>` elements for shapes with a type of "polygon". Each shape is colored according to its `color` property and positioned using the `x` and `y` coordinates. The SVG string has a width of 500px and a height of 500px.

### Usage

1. Open the JavaScript file.
2. Locate the `generateSVG` function.
3. Provide a JSON array of shape objects with the specified properties.
4. The function will generate an SVG string based on the given shapes.
5. Use the generated SVG string as desired in your project.

## Part 3: JavaScript + Arrays

### Description

The JavaScript code includes operations on an array of arrays. The provided array, `array1`, consists of sub-arrays containing two elements: the first index is an integer, and the second index is a string.

1. The code searches for an element in the array where the first index is 12 and prints the corresponding second index.
2. The code orders the array by distinct values of the first element of each sub-array.

### Usage

1. Open the JavaScript file.
2. Locate the provided array, `array1`.
3. The code includes logic to search for the desired element and print the second index if found.
4. The code also includes logic to order the array by distinct values of the first element.
5. Test the code with different scenarios as needed.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of JavaScript functions for handling shapes and arrays. Use the provided code as a reference or integrate it into your own project as required.
